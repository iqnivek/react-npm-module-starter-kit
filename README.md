# React npm module starter kit

A simple starter kit for creating new npm modules using webpack, babel/ES6, and react.

## Getting started

Clone this repo, cd into it, and copy this repo's files and directories into a new project without the git stuff:

```
git clone https://github.com/iqnivek/react-npm-module-starter-kit.git
cd react-npm-module-starter-kit
git checkout-index -a --prefix=../PATH_TO_PROJECT/YOUR_PROJECT_NAME/
```

Then, fill out `package.json`.
